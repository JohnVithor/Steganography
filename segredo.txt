	BMP
The BMP file format, also known as bitmap image file or device independent bitmap (DIB) file format or simply a bitmap, is a raster graphics image file format used to store bitmap digital images, independently of the display device (such as a graphics adapter), especially on Microsoft Windows[1] and OS/2[2] operating systems.

The BMP file format is capable of storing two-dimensional digital images both monochrome and color, in various color depths, and optionally with data compression, alpha channels, and color profiles. The Windows Metafile (WMF) specification covers the BMP file format.[3] Among others wingdi.h defines BMP constants and structures.

The PBM format was invented by Jef Poskanzer in the 1980s as a format that allowed monochrome bitmaps to be transmitted within an email message as plain ASCII text, allowing it to survive any changes in text formatting.[5] Poskanzer developed the first library of tools to handle the PBM format, Pbmplus, released in 1988. It mainly contained tools to convert between PBM and other graphics formats. By the end of 1988, Poskanzer had developed the PGM and PPM formats along with their associated tools and added them to Pbmplus. The final release of Pbmplus was December 10, 1991.

In 1993, the Netpbm library was developed to replace the unmaintained Pbmplus. It was simply a repackaging of Pbmplus with additions and fixes submitted by people all over the world.[6]chamado em inglês de raster, e portanto gerando arquivos grandes e não compactados evita-se o uso do mesmo em aplicações que exijam tráfego rápido de dados como na Internet, pois o formato padrão gráfico na Web são o JPG ou JPEG, PNG e o GIF. Esse formato era usado pelos gráficos de subsistema (GDI) da Microsoft Windows, mas cada vez menos usado na prática, ou somente utilizado em aplicações mais específicas devido ao tamanho dos arquivos gerados.
